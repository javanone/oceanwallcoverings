                <p>“Brian Conn installed period wallcovering in our historic house museum in Berlin, MD in March 2011. We couldn't be more pleased with his installation or the finished result. Working with consultants we had just completed an historic paint
                    finishes study and interior finishes plan and it was very important to us to restore this part of our historic house to its 1830s time period, starting with the installation of the Adelphi block paper and border in our stairwell and
                    entry. Since we were also interested in having it installed "as it would have been," Brian coordinated with our historic interiors consultant on paper hanging specifications and provided us with a beautiful recreation of an historic
                    interior. We are thrilled with our wallcovering and it continues to be a visitor highlight during our house tours. We would highly recommend Brian for any wallcovering project.”</p>

                <p>“Brian Conn was strongly recommended by Adelphi for both his experience in hanging their paper and for the quality of his work. Brian was fantastic – a great communicator, very professional yet very down to earth, patient, understanding,
                    and a real pleasure to interact with. He did a superb job in hanging our special wall paper in 2014. Now, two years later it looks just as good as the day he finished. I would use him again for any future wallpaper installations we
                    might do and would also recommend him to other house museums as well as private home owners.”</p>

                    He made our client feel at ease, as well as us. When the job was remote, he promptly sent pictures for us to review. Great service!”

                <br><br> “The project was an important investment for us and before proceeding we hoped to find someone with experience in using historic Adelphi papers to do our installation. We learned of Brian after seeing his work with Adelphi papers
                at the Calvin B. Taylor House museum in Berlin Maryland. His prior experience and availability to work with us on the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland gave us the confidence we needed to move forward with our project. We are pleased to
                recommend Brian to you and others - he proved to be highly skilled, professional, and timely in his work, and we would certainly call on him in the future should we have additional wallpapering projects.
                <br><br> As Brian noted, our project involved several rooms, and different Adelphi products and treatments, including seamed roll wallpapers (typical of papers pre-1840), friezes and borders: (custom colored “Plymouth Ashlar” in the entry
                hall, “Lion Frieze” and “Greek Key” border in the north Parlor, “Grapevine Frieze” and “Greek Key” border in the south Parlor, “Chevron and Laurel” wallpaper and Frieze in the dining room, and “Jefferson Trellis” wallpaper in the bedroom).
                <br><br> We provided Brian keys to our house and he worked independently, which was important for us since we do not reside full time in the home. He was also flexible in approaching the project as we expanded it to include additional
                rooms and treatments, and guided us in various decision points associated with the installations (including borders around complex fireplace mantles, quirky corners, and treatments involving air return vents). Brian also provided us with
                status reports during the course of the installation and contacted us as necessary with any questions he had. Brian worked cleanly and meticulously, and probably left our home cleaner than he found it.
                <br><br> Our Adelphi paper treatments are holding up well and we haven’t noticed any issue or defect associated with the installation. Our home was on the Maryland House and Garden Pilgrimage in 2013 and the Adelphi paper treatments were
                much commented on.”
